			<h1>üßöüèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è‚ú® hi there!</h1>
			<p>
				Welcome! My name is <b>Hailey Garcia</b>. I'm entering my final year at the University of California, 
				Berkeley, studying Electrical Engineering and Computer Science and Business Administration through
				the <a href="https://met.berkeley.edu/">Management, Entrepreneurship, and Technology Program</a>. 
			</p>
			<p>
				I‚Äôm from the Bay Area, and growing up, I saw first hand the implications of technology and the 
				‚ÄòSilicon Valley mindset‚Äô on my community. As such, I‚Äôm passionate about leveraging technology to 
				empower marginalized communities, rather than harming them. I‚Äôm particularly interested in the intersection
				of race and the environment and how we can use technology to levy inequalities. 
			</p>
			<p>
				For my past three years at Cal, I've been extremely privileged to explore a few of my interests more in depth, 
				which you can read more about <a href="/experience">here</a>. Some things I'd love to highlight are is my work at 
				the <a href="https://scecberkeley.wixsite.com/scec"> Students of Color Environmental Collective</a>, where I've taught
				the ESPM 198: Environmentalists of Color DeCal for the past two years.
				Additionally, I worked as a Software Engineering intern at Meta, a Summer Associate at EY-Parthenon's Software Strategy Group,
				and most recently, Duolingo as an Associate Product Management Intern. Although I've had a diverse set of experiences,
				they've all given me insight into how I can use technology to make a positive impact on the world.
			</p>
			<p>
				Outside of work, I absolutely love to read (check my <a href="/favorites">favorites</a> out!), hiking, and trying out new cafes.
